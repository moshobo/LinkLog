        "description": "Per @endricus.bsky.social on Bluesky, Car #306 was testing on the segment between Judkins Park Station and the Chinatown-International District station. This follows recent work by Sound Transit over previous weekend to tie-in the 1 Line and the 2 Line before the CID station. Seeing this train in action on that segment of rail suggest that the major electrical work is complete and ready for final testing.",
